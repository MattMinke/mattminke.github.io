The thought of creating a blog has been rattling around in my head for quite sometime and recently a friend of mine started one and I figured it was time I do the same. Technology and the outdoors are two big parts of my life so I figure at this point that will be what I write about but time will tell. Who knows maybe I will discover I don't really want to write about technology or the outdoors and instead find enjoyment in blogging about roundabouts, or why the earth is not flat (highly doubt that but we will find out). 

So why blogging
===============
Like a lot of people I wanted to get my thoughts out and cataloged somewhere. I though about vlogging and or podcasting but quickly decided I was not ready to invest that much time in sharing my thoughts and blogging seemed like the ideal level of commitment at the moment. I don't know how focused my writing will be or if this is going to be something I enjoy doing but I want to give it a shot. 

The platform
============
When I started looking at different blogging tools for this endeavor I wanted a platform that took care of a lot of the technical details for me and had an easy level of entry, but still allowed me to jump into the technical end of the pool if I so desired. Now you may say "Hey Matt you are a developer why not just write a site from scratch?" and the answer is simple. I want to blog, I don't want to develop a blogging platform. I have enough project on my plate at the moment. Also there is no reason to re-invent the wheel and create another blogging platform. There are already so many good platforms available.

I ended up deciding on using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and more specifically [Github pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). Now you may be asking why Jekyll and Github pages. That seems like a really odd combination of tools for a personal blog and it might be, but I think fits my needs well right now. It gives be the ability to get to the work at hand, which is blogging and writing, with tools I am already familiar with (Git, Markdown, Visual Studio) and use on a daily basis while also learning new tools. And as a bonus my cost of entry at the moment is only my time. Eventually I will buy a domain name but I want to make sure this is something I really want to do before I invest money (even if it's $15 or $20 a year).
